# Polyp Segmentation using Majority Voting - FYP

## Abstract

Colorectal cancer ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in recent years. A significant percentage of these cancers originate in the intestines, potentially leading to a global rise in cancer-related deaths. Conventional colonoscopy, highly reliant on an endoscopist's expertise, is the standard for screening and diagnosis. However, accurately detecting and segmenting polyps remains challenging despite advancements in technology. Our project aims to facilitate early and precise polyp diagnosis using cutting-edge Deep Learning models, leveraging architectures like Res-Net50, Res-Net101, U-net, and others. These models are pretrained on comprehensive polyps datasets like Kvasir-SEG and CVC-Clinic 612, enhancing detection performance.

Preprocessing the Data

We employ various data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity and quality of the dataset, crucial for improving the model's accuracy and robustness.

### Training Models

Our approach includes training different models to compare their effectiveness in polyp segmentation:

- U-Net
- ResNet
- ResUnet++
- ColonSegNet
- Double−UNet

##  Web Application

To streamline the polyp detection process, we have developed a web application using Streamlit and Firebase. This app allows for easy uploading and processing of endoscopic images, with the results presented in a downloadable PDF report format.

##  Datasets

The project utilizes datasets from Simula Research Lab, which have been further augmented to enhance the model's training. The original and augmented datasets are available at the following links:
